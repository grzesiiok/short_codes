'''
A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.

He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

- h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3

- h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1

    n = h*bounce
    num = 1
    if bounce < 1 and h>window and h*bounce*window>0:
        if n!= window:
            while (n >= window):
                num += 1
                n = n * bounce
                num += 1
